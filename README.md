# 😴 Undergraduate Sleep Management System 🎓

## [Overview](pplx://action/followup)

This project is a web application designed to help university students manage and improve their sleep quality 🌙. It addresses the challenges students face due to academic pressures 📚, irregular schedules 📅, and unhealthy habits 🍔. The application uses machine learning 🤖 to predict sleep quality based on user-provided data and offers personalized recommendations to promote better sleep habits.

## [Key Features](pplx://action/followup)

*   **[😴 Sleep Quality Prediction](pplx://action/followup):** Predicts a user's sleep quality (on a scale of 1-10) based on factors like age, gender, university year, sleep duration, study hours, screen time, caffeine intake, and physical activity. Explainable AI (XAI) provides insights into how each factor impacts the score.
*   **[✨ Personalized Recommendations](pplx://action/followup):** Provides actionable plans and recommendations tailored to the user's specific sleep patterns and lifestyle, potentially drawing on a panel of doctors' expertise 👨‍⚕️. Includes gamification elements to encourage adherence.
*   **[📝 Sleep Journal & History](pplx://action/followup):** Allows users to track their sleep data, including subjective sleep quality ratings and integration with wearable devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch) for automatic data import 📲.
*   **[🎯 Goal Setting & Progress Tracking](pplx://action/followup):** Enables users to set sleep-related goals and track their progress. Adaptive goal setting adjusts tasks based on daily progress.
*   **[📊 Data Analytics Dashboard](pplx://action/followup):** Provides a dashboard with visualizations of sleep patterns, trends, and the option for anonymous peer comparison. Predictive analytics identify potential sleep issues.
*   **[🌱 Lifestyle Management Tools](pplx://action/followup):** Includes features like study schedule optimization (integrating with calendar apps 🗓️) and mindfulness/relaxation exercises 🧘.
